                <p>The Serum Institute of India was founded in 1966 and is the largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses produced and sold globally. An estimated 65 percent of the children in the world receive at least one vaccine manufactured by the Institute. Its facilities operate under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines, have been accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) and comply with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
                  requirements for quality, purity, efficacy and safety.</p>

                <p>The company is the world's largest vaccine producer by number of doses produced.The company produces around 130 crore (1.3 billion) doses of vaccines each year. The products developed include tuberculosis vaccine Tubervac (BCG), 
                  Poliovac for poliomyelitis, and other vaccinations for the childhood vaccination schedule.</p>
                <p>As of 2009, the institute was developing an intranasal swine flu vaccine.In 2016, with support from US-based Mass Biologics of University of Massachusetts Medical School, it invented a fast-acting anti-rabies agent, 
                  Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody (RMAb), also known as Rabishield.</p>
                  <p>The company made its first international acquisition when it acquired Biltthoven biologicals, 
                    a pharmaceutical company in Netherlands in 2012</p>

                    <p>The company has tied up with pharma firm AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in partnership with Oxford University.It is reported that Serum Institute would provide 10 crore (100 million) doses of the vaccine in India and other low and middle-income countries.[17][18][19] It is estimated to be priced at ₹225 (around $3) per dose.[20] In September 2020, trials were halted by DGCI after a volunteer in Oxford developed illness following a dosage,
                       but were soon resumed after consent by the British regulators.</p>
                       <p>They have also reached an agreement with Novavax for the development and commercialisation of Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373 COVID‑19 vaccine candidate in India and other low and middle-income countries.
                         The company will also produce Codagenix's nasally administered COVID-19 vaccine, CDX-005.</p>

                  <p>Today marks an important step in our efforts to advance the development of CDX-005,” said Dr J. Robert Coleman, CEO of Codagenix. “Currently, there are no licensed vaccines for COVID-19. Given the scale of the pandemic – more than 28 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 900,000 deaths – the normal development process of waiting until after 
                    a vaccine has been proven effective to begin manufacturing wastes precious time.</p>
